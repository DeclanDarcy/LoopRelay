# Architectural Capabilities

This matrix records architectural capabilities as they become observable, protected, certified, and documented during the post-MVP architecture program.

| Capability | Introduced | Protected | Certified | Reference Documentation | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Structural verification | 0.1 | 0.1, future architectural regression framework | 0.1 local command-line baseline | `docs/architectural-mechanisms.md` | Certified locally with quarantines |

## Structural Verification

Structural verification is the ability to run known verifier entry points and understand what each one protects before architectural migration begins.

The current certified scope is local command-line verification only. CI verification, IDE integration, packaged Tauri release verification, and Rust shell behavioral coverage are not certified.

The certified local baseline is recorded in `.agents/milestones/m0.1-structural-verification-certification.md`.

Accepted quarantines:

- missing CI baseline,
- serialized .NET verifier execution,
- absent Rust shell behavioral coverage,
- unknown IDE verification path,
- unknown Tauri packaged release path.

The next protection to add is a shell passive response relay regression that proves opaque backend JSON is preserved without shell-owned domain interpretation.
