# Architectural Mechanisms

Architectural mechanisms are executable or governed protections that make architecture invariants observable, verifiable, enforceable, recoverable, or easier to maintain.

## Verification Baseline

Introduced: Milestone 0.1.

Status: certified for local command-line verification with bounded quarantines.

Primary evidence:

- `.agents/milestones/m0.1-structural-verification-slice-0001.md`
- `.agents/milestones/m0.1-structural-verification-slice-0002.md`
- `.agents/milestones/m0.1-structural-verification-certification.md`

Accepted verifier entry points:

| Surface | Command | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| .NET build | `dotnet build CommandCenter.slnx` | Run serially with backend tests. |
| Backend tests | `dotnet test tests/CommandCenter.Backend.Tests/CommandCenter.Backend.Tests.csproj` | Run serially with solution build. |
| TypeScript build | `npm run build` in `src/CommandCenter.UI` | Runs `tsc -b` before Vite. |
| Frontend lint | `npm run lint` in `src/CommandCenter.UI` | Static frontend verification. |
| Frontend tests | `npm run test` in `src/CommandCenter.UI` | Vitest characterization suite. |
| Browser E2E | `npm run test:e2e` in `src/CommandCenter.UI` | Playwright workspace coverage. |
| Rust build | `cargo build` in `src/CommandCenter.Shell` | Shell compiler health. |
| Rust tests | `cargo test` in `src/CommandCenter.Shell` | Test harness executes, but currently discovers 0 tests. |

## Current Quarantines

| Mechanism gap | Risk | Retirement condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Missing CI baseline | Local-only verification is not remotely enforced. | Add CI that runs the accepted baseline or an approved supported subset. |
| Serialized .NET execution | Parallel build/test runs can contend for shared outputs. | Prove isolated output paths or another build isolation mechanism. |
| Rust shell behavioral coverage absent | Shell transport can drift while Rust still compiles. | Add passive response relay regression for opaque JSON preservation. |
| IDE verification path unknown | IDE feedback can disagree with command-line verification. | Inventory IDE validation or formally scope it outside verifier authority. |
| Tauri packaged release path unknown | Release packaging can fail outside local compile checks. | Add or quarantine a release verifier before release-path claims. |

## Mechanism Lifecycle Rule

A verifier can be treated as architectural protection only when its command or source, protected surface, known gaps, owner, and retirement criteria for any quarantine are recorded.

Weakening, removing, or bypassing an accepted verifier requires a decision record and replacement or quarantine evidence.
